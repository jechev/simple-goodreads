      "description": "Amy’s Uncle Al and her mother Ariel both seem to have insider knowledge that something terrible is going to happen in Manhattan on September 11, 2001. Thousands heeded Ariel’s warning in The Chrislamic Messenger to flee New York City. But how did they know? The military believes Amy’s father is somehow behind 9/11, even though he is supposedly dead and buried. As a weapons technologist, he was custodian of two Mark 53 nuclear bombs that were jettisoned by a failing B-52 over Champlain Lake at the same time he went missing in 1978. Now, years later, he seems to have come back from the dead. Only Amy can stop her uncle from executing her father’s plan to detonate one of the massive bombs inside a uranium mine in the Adirondacks, causing a cataclysmic chain reaction that would create a sixth Great Lake and precipitate evacuation of the Eastern seaboard. Uncle Al is intent on stopping Amy from alerting authorities, by supplying her Chrislamic mother with evidence that although Amy swears she is a virgin, she and her cousin Ron have been indulging in “fornication.” According to Sharia law and Deuteronomy 13, Amy must be stoned to death. As Uncle Al prepares to detonate the dirtiest bomb in history, Ron attempts to stop Amy’s stoning before New York State blows sky high.",

      "description": "In real-life clairvoyant D. J. Adam's second crime thriller, her fictional Lindsay Freeman takes on two serial killers who stalk teenagers at shopping malls, torture and kill them. Lindsay is called in to track Rebecca Torman, who has been kidnapped while shopping for her prom dress at the mall near her home in a small town New England. Three other Ripney High School students have already been murdered when Rebecca disappears. Lindsay is drawn into the web of drugs, alcohol, rage and all the dreams that come undone because of them. For four terrible days she delves into the minds of serial killers Mike Hennessey and his pathological sidekick Tony Garrison in a desperate search for Rebecca before she is brutally killed like her classmates. D.J. Adams has based this thriller on the case she now says was \"so heinous that it has taken me years to write it down, years to want to recall it.\"",

      "description": "In the summer of 1946, the most wide-open town in America is Hot Springs, Arkansas, a city of ancient, legendary corruption. While the pilgrims take the cure in the mineral-rich 142-degree water that bubbles from the earth, the brothels and casinos are the true source of the town's prosperity. It is run by an English-born gangster named Owney Maddox, who represents the New York syndicate and rules his empire like a Saxon lord while sporting an ascot and jodhpurs. But it is all about to be challenged. A newly elected county prosecutor wants to take on the big boys and save the city's soul (he also wouldn't mind being the next governor). He begins a war on the gambling interests and, knowing the war will be long and bloody, hires an ex-Marine sergeant, Earl Swagger, who won the Medal of Honor on Iwo Jima, to run it. Swagger knows how to fight with guns as well as any man in the world. But he is haunted: the savage fighting he just barely survived and the men he left behind in the Pacific still shadow his mind, leaving a terrible melancholy. There are even darker memories: a murdered father who beat him mercilessly and drove a younger brother to suicide. And he's torn by his own impending fatherhood, as his wife, Junie, nears term. It isn't that Earl Swagger is afraid of dying; more scary still, it's possible that he yearns for it. The gangsters fight back, setting up a campaign of ambush and counterambush in the brothels, casinos and alleys of the City of the Vapors. Raids erupt into full-out combat amid screaming prostitutes and fleeing johns. The body count mounts. Meanwhile, the politics behind the war are shifting: Will the prosecuting attorney stick with his raiders or sell them out to curry favor with the state's political machine? Will Owney Maddox defeat the raiders but lose a personal battle against a cunning rival from the West who foresees a Hot Springs in the Nevada desert as the future franchise city of organized crime? But most important, will Earl Swagger survive yet another hard war, not merely with his body but also with his soul intact? Packed with page-turning action, sex, sin and crime, Stephen Hunter's <i>Hot Springs</i> is at once a relentlessly violent and deeply touching story.",
